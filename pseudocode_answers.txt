Why do programmers use pseudocode?
To make programming complex algorithms easier by first writing it out in human readable language.



If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

It would not work.


Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

INPUT first number
INPUT second number
IF first number is less than second number
PRINT second number
END IF
ELSE PRINT first number
END ELSE



Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

CREATE variable counter
WHILE counter is LESS THAN 100 
PRINT counter
ADD Counter Iteration
END WHILE


Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.
INPUT entry
SET variable ent to INPUT
FOR LOOP iterate through phonebook

Compare phonebook to ent
IF ent matches phonebook value
RETURN true
END IF
ELSE
RETURN false 
END ELSE

END FOR LOOP


Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.
