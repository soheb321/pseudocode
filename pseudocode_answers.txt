Why do programmers use pseudocode?
To make programming complex algorithms easier by first writing it out in human readable language.



If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

It would not work.


Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

INPUT 2 numbers
Compare first number and second number
Print out  bigger number



Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

CREATE variable counter
WHILE counter is LESS THAN 100 the function PRINTS out value of counter


Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

Set variable ent to specific entry
Use FOR LOOP to iterate through phonebook
While iterating, compare values of phonebook to ent
IF ent matches phonebook value
RETURN true
ELSE
RETURN false 


Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.
