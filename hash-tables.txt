1.What is a hash table?
Type of structure that stores values by linking it to a unique key. 

2.What is hashing?
The process of converting strings to an integer. 

3. How does a hash table store data?
Take the Key.
-Convert the Key to a Hash Code using a Hashing Function.
-Mod the Hash Code to get an Array Index.
-Store the Value in the Array Index.

4.How are hash tables and objects different?
Hash tables are like arrays in which you store similar data collections. 
Hash objects hold different types of data together. 


Determine whether you would use a hash table or an object to store each of the following pieces of data:

    this.number = number;
    this.address = address;
    this.list = [] 
  }
  set(name, number, address) {
    this.list[number] = [name, number, address];
  }
  get(number) {
    return this.list[number]
  }
}
