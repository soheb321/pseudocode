1.What is the main difference between a stack and a queue?
Stack uses LIFO while queue uses FIFO


2.What are the similarities between stacks and queues?
Allow for an order of operations, that let an engineer to store data.


3.Imagine you are an engineer tasked with implementing the UNDO and REDO options in a word processor such as Microsoft Word. Which data structure would you use for each option and why?
LIFO for UNDO because you want to remove the last added data.
LIFO for REDO because you want to re-add the last deleted data.



Programming Questions
You may program the following question in any language of your choice. Before you begin coding, write out a plan as to how you will solve the question.

4. Given a string, reverse it using a stack. For example, the string "Bloc!" should be converted to "!colB".

var tester = "Soheb";
function reverseString(data){
  
  let stack = [ ];
  var reverse = '';

  for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++)
    stack.push(data[i]);
  

  for (let i = stack.length-1; i >= 0; i--)
    reverse += stack[i];
  return reverse;

}
console.log(reverseString(tester));
            



5. Implement the pop method of a stack using one queue. Make a FIFO data structure mirror the functionality of a LIFO data structure. Since the internal list is not the same as defined in the checkpoint, it may help to rewrite the pseudocode first.

function popMethod(data) {
   let list = [];
   for (let i = 0; i < data.length-1; i++){
    list.push(data[i]);}

   let deleted = data[data.length-1];
   return deleted;
}
 




6.  Implement the enqueue and dequeue methods defined in the checkpoint inside your own Queue class.

Class Queue{
constructor{
this.sample = []
}

 function enQue(data){

   this.sample.push(data);

   }

 function deQue(data){
   return this.sample.shift();

   }

}
