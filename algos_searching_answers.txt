1.What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?
Searching for a name in a list of winners in a race/ olympic event. 

2.What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?
Searching for a specific movie title in a sorted alphabetical list 

3.Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?
7
4.Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?
3

5.Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
Linear because binary doesn't work unless sorted.

6.Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
Binary because you could split the list in half saving many iterations.



You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.


var birds = ["Parrot", "Albatross","Falcon","Eagle", "Seagull", "Vulture", "Pigeon", "Blue Jay", "Mocking Bird"]
// Typically I would use a binary search, however since the sorted array will alphabetically make A the first few names, it would be 
//advantageous to just use linear search to avoid further iterations. This would also apply if we used an actual dictionary with a variety of other words too.
var name = "Albatross";

  
  var sorted = birds.sort()
  

function findBird(birdList, bird){
for(i = 0; i < birdList.length; i++){
  if(birdList[i] == bird){
    return "Found it!"
  }
  }
}

console.log(findBird(sorted, name));


You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

var tank = ["Shark", "Beta Fish","Piranha","Octopus","Eel", "StringRay","JellyFish","Goldfish"]
var target = "Goldfish";
function findFish(list, name){
for(var i = 0; i< list.length; i++){
  if(list[i]== name){
    return "Got it!"
  }
}
}

console.log(findFish(tank, target))
